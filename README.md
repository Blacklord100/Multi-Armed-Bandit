# Multi-Armed-Bandit

Hi!
This project was done with my friend Hugo Mallet. We focused on discussing MAB testing with online FDR control. Please feel free to have a look and hit us up.

The little code snippet we included helps visualizing what is a MAB. I will recommend you having a look at it to understand what is Multi-Armed-Bandit.

If there are any misunderstanding or mistakes comment !
